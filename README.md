# RNN--TV-Script-Generation-Project-Udacity
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

### Get the Data
The data is already provided for you in ./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt and you're encouraged to open that file and look at the text.

As a first step, we'll load in this data and look at some samples.
Then, you'll be tasked with defining and training an RNN to generate a new script!

### Please Note:
### I've executed this project work on my local machine with all the project rubrics to meet all required specifications of Udacity Nanodegree Program & uploaded here for reference.
